## Drug Rating Prediction

Given the Drug name, patient condition and reviews of around **280k** samples, the objective is to predict the drug rating (1 to 10) given by the patient for the drug based on past ratings.

We preprocess the textual information and analyse text sentiment. Then train an LSTM model to predict rating given by the patients.
